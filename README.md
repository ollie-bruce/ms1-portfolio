# Milestone Project 1 - Portfolio Website

---

## Introduction

[View the live project here.](https://ollie-bruce.github.io/ms1-portfolio/)

This website was designed with the intent of providing Oliver Bruce, the developer, with an easy-to-access resource that archives both videography works and web development projects alongside key information for future employers in both fields.

For the purposes of the Code Institute Web Application Development Diploma, this is the first of four Milestone Projects, wherein the requirements were to make a responsive website of at least three pages primarily using **HTML** and **CSS**.
