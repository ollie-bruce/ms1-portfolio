# Milestone Project 1 - Portfolio Website


## Introduction

[View the live project here.](https://ollie-bruce.github.io/ms1-portfolio/)

This website was designed with the intent of providing Oliver Bruce, the developer, with an easy-to-access resource that archives both videography works and web development projects alongside key information for future employers in both fields.

For the purposes of the Code Institute Web Application Development Diploma, this is the first of four Milestone Projects, wherein the requirements were to make a responsive website of at least three pages primarily using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## UX

### User Demographics

There are two key demographics for this website:

* **Oliver Bruce** as the site owner

* **Future employers of Oliver**

### User stories

#### As Oliver, I want:

1. To easily provide employers with a showcase of my best work.
2. To easily provide employers with information about myself and my skills.
3. To easily provide employers access to my CV and contact information.
4. A professional, clean layout that is itself a showcase of my abilities.
5. An easy-to-access archive of my work that I can refer back to and edit with ease.

#### As a future employer, I want:

1. Easy access to the body of Oliver's work relevant to the field in which he has applied for.
   * Separate pages for Videography and Development projects, clearly delineated.
2. Easy access to information about Oliver's skillset.
3. Easy access to Oliver's CV and contact information.
   * A separate link for Oliver's CV for future record-keeping and in-depth information.
   * A separate contact page.
4. A demonstration of some of Oliver's skills via the website itself.

As such, when determining **strategy**, the following factors were taken into account:

* The primary demographic of the website are professionals in the creative industries, either as web developers or videographers.
* These professionals, as future employers, are most likely to be in a position of management in order to have say over hiring decisions, putting their ages between 25-35 years.
* They will value professionalism and modern aesthetic sensibilities (i.e. no cluttered designs or too loud colours).
* The website needs to allow easy access to whatever information employers will need to see if Oliver is suitable for a job he has applied for.
* The website needs to provide as in-depth an insight possible into the body of Oliver's work across both videography and web development for practical demonstration of the skills he claims to have.

This then helped the developer to define the **scope** of the project and what would features would need to be included:

#### Users will need access to:

* A summary of Oliver's skills in both videography and web development.
* Oliver's CV
* A videography portfolio
* A web development portfolio
* Oliver's contact details/a way to contact Oliver directly.

#### In terms of function the website will need to:

* Allow the user to easily find whatever information they are looking for.
* Allow the user to easily find external links to:
  * YouTube videos
  * GitHub repos
* Provide a direct download link for Oliver's CV in a common file format in an accessible manner.
* Give users an avenue through which to contact Oliver, either:
  * Through contact information provided in his CV.
  * Through a direct Contact page on the website.

As such, a **structure** was then decided upon for the website:

#### Home Page

* Name and Professions

#### About

* Photo
* Bio
* Skills summary

#### Videography

* Links to videos produced by Oliver (YouTube Embeds)
* Short blurbs describing videos

#### Development

* Links to GitHub repos/websites developed by Oliver
* Short blurbs describing projects

#### Contact Me

* A contact form

On all pages a **Footer** was to be present to provide constant access to:

* Oliver's CV

### Wireframes

In order to better visualise what the website would look like for both building it and initial feedback, wireframes were created by the developer before building the website. The most complete of these was created in [Figma Workspace.](https://www.figma.com/file/EvvQTNHQmvHxHteGiUXKtr/Milestone-Project-1-Portfolio-Website?node-id=0%3A1)

#### Homepage

#### About

#### Videography/Development

In doing the wireframes, the developer considered that, to keep design consistency and enable easier navigation, that the videography page and development page would use the same overall layout for displaying the projects that would be presented.
